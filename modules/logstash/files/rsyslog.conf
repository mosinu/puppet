# If you experience problems, see http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/troubleshoot.html

#### MODULES ####

$ModLoad imuxsock # provides support for local system logging (e.g. via logger command)
$ModLoad imklog   # provides kernel logging support (previously done by rklogd)
$ModLoad immark  # provides --MARK-- message capability

# Provides UDP syslog reception
$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514

# Provides TCP syslog reception
$ModLoad imtcp
$InputTCPServerRun 514


#### GLOBAL DIRECTIVES ####

# Use default timestamp format
$ActionFileDefaultTemplate RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat

# File syncing capability is disabled by default. This feature is usually not required,
# not useful and an extreme performance hit
#$ActionFileEnableSync on

# Include all config files in /etc/rsyslog.d/
$IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf


#### RULES ####
#
#### IMPORTANT #### 
#
# These need to be in order of how they should be handled
# The & ~ stops sending the log to match other rules
# IE: No sending logs to 2 log files
# This is important for the cisco logs rules below so
# they do not end up in /var/log/messages and /var/log/bootlog
#
#
# Log all kernel messages to the console.
# Logging much else clutters up the screen.
#kern.*                                                 /dev/console

# Matching Cisco devices per source and sending them to a seperate log
# for logstash.

# Stop cisco rules and lets go back to normal processing
#
# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!

# The authpriv file has restricted access.

# ### begin forwarding rule ###
# The statement between the begin ... end define a SINGLE forwarding
# rule. They belong together, do NOT split them. If you create multiple
# forwarding rules, duplicate the whole block!
# Remote Logging (we use TCP for reliable delivery)
#
# An on-disk queue is created for this action. If the remote host is
# down, messages are spooled to disk and sent when it is up again.
#$WorkDirectory /var/lib/rsyslog # where to place spool files
#$ActionQueueFileName fwdRule1 # unique name prefix for spool files
#$ActionQueueMaxDiskSpace 1g   # 1gb space limit (use as much as possible)
#$ActionQueueSaveOnShutdown on # save messages to disk on shutdown
#$ActionQueueType LinkedList   # run asynchronously
#$ActionResumeRetryCount -1    # infinite retries if host is down
# Remote Logging with On Disk Queuring Enabled
$ActionQueueType LinkedList         # Asynchronous Forwarding Mechanism
$ActionQueueFileName centralwork    # Enable disk mode queue
$ActionResumeRetryCount -1          # Infinite Retries
$ActionQueueSaveOnShutdown on       # Save Queue on Exit for reprocessing
